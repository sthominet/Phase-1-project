This is a single page application using HTML, CSS and JS that accesses data from the National Park Service. 

In this application, the visitor landing on the page selects a state from the dropdown menu, clicks the 'submit' button and gets a list of parks in the state. Each 'card' generated includes the name of the park, a like button, a short description and a link to the url giving the directions to the park.
